## Credits

The original theme was done by John Papa and this fork focuses on what the theme looked like before the main refactor he did a year ago. Minor changes might be implemented but overall the look and feel will remain similar to how it's now.

Credit where credit is due ... this theme was inspired by the themes Visual Studio Dark+, Monokai and [Dustin Sander's theme for "An Old Hope"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dustinsanders.an-old-hope-theme-vscode). Custom CSS inspired by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos).
